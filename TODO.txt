TODO list for the environment manager integration project

1. Improvements in the client

1.1. The client currently receives and returns JSON objects.  This should be
abstracted, and handwritten classes should be created.  For instance, instead
of returning a JSON object for the Provisions#createProvisionEvent(...) method.
It should return an Event object, which contains the relevant fields and an 
array of Step objects.

1.2. The client needs to be completed.  Initial implementation only implemented
the API methods needed for the initial jenkins integration.  Missing methods
should be added for completeness.

1.3. The client needs to be versioned.  Currently it will only work for V1 of
the environment manager API.  When subsequent versions are released, it will
need to be updated for those versions. But in order to maintain backward
compatibility, multiple versions of the client will be needed.
